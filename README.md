Mini-Bescherelle

This LaTeX project is to create a mini-bescherelle with the most common conjugations of the most common French verbs. The source code format can be quickly changed to add more verbs, change which conjugations are displayed or even which language to use. 

To add a new verb in the same format, simply copy and paste the template code (or another, existing verb) and change the conjugations. The conjugations are stored using an array from the `listofitems` package. 

To change which conjugations are displayed or the formatting of each individual table, you can change the document `make-verb-tables.tex`. 

This project was created as a quick reference by Benjamin MacLellan for the Explore French Immersion Program in Trois-Pistoles, QC.
